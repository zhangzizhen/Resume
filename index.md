## Zizhen Zhang

I am a coach of SYSU ACM/ICPC team. I also act as a committee member for Youth Education of Computing in Guangdong. My research interests are broadly in the area of AI (artificial intelligence) and OR (operations research).

Recently I am working on Deep Reinforcement Learni1ng, Graph Neural Networks and their applications in Combinatorial Optimization Problems, using AlphaGo-like techniques. If you are interested in this promising area, please read the following papers and discuss with me.
